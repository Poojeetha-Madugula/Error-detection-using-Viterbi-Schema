# Error-detection-using-Viterbi-Schema

## Objective:
The objective of this experiment is to investigate the effect of increasing the constraint length of a convolutional code on its error-correction capability. Two convolutional codes with rates of 1/2 and constraint lengths of 3 and 5 were tested, with the goal of understanding how these design factors influence the failure rate of the code under noisy conditions.

## Conclusions:
The experiment revealed that increasing the constraint length from 3 to 5 did not result in a significant improvement in error-correction capability for the tested convolutional codes. Decoding failed at the same rate for both codes when subjected to 10 faults, indicating equal failure rates. 

This suggests that additional design factors beyond constraint length and generator polynomials may be necessary to produce convolutional codes with lower failure rates. Strategies such as interleaving and puncturing are potential avenues for improving the performance of convolutional codes under noisy conditions, warranting further investigation and experimentation.
